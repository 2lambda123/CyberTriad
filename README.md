# Cyber Triad
## or how to spot Antifragility in Cyber Security

After re-reading „Antifragility“ by Nassim Taleb, I‘ll went on mapping the
_Triad_ (fragility, robustness, antifragility) to different areas of cyber
security and their characteristics. I don‘t know where that‘s leading to and
whether it has a value at all. But it‘s fun as a thought experiment anyways.
Maybe it’s easier to discuss a future initiative with this _Triad_ in mind. So
let‘s detect fragility and the position of different topics in the _Triad_ and 
answer „What has more upside than downside?“.

As in the words of Nassim Taleb:

> This is the key to the Triad - we can classify things by three simple
> distinctions: things, that in the long run, like disturbances (or errors),
> things that are neutral to them, and those that dislike them.

And

>The Triad gives us some indication of what should be done to live in a world
>that does not want us to understand it.

Cyber security is exposed to uncertainty in all the involved fields, from
prevention, to detection, to technology in general and at most to
unpredictable attackers, _Gegenspieler_ so to speak.

Let’s see how we can change it and start appreciating randomness and
uncertainty to improve the (cyber) security for all of us. To my dear reader,
with just a click of pull request it’s possible to contribute to the Cyber
Triad!
